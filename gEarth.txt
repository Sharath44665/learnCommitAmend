Let’s say you’re a travel journalist and you want to be able to demonstrate 
where you’ve been around the world when pitching 
to new clients. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create such presentations 
on Google Earth.
1. Get Google Earth and Drive

You can now use Google Earth on any browser, not just Chrome.
If you’ve never tried the app before, you can find out more about it 
by visiting the Google Earth website. From there, hit the Launch Earth 
button to log in with your Google account.

Also, the app mainly uses Google Drive to store the projects you create, 
so it’s a good idea to set up an account before making your first presentation.

2. Launch Google Earth and Find the Projects Tool

Once you’ve signed in to Google Earth, our digital planet will appear on 
your screen with several features on the left sidebar, such as map styles and 
Google’s tool for measuring area and distance.

Select the Projects icon and, assuming you don’t already have a
presentation, click Create and then choose whether you want to
store the new project on Google Drive or as a KML file—it stands 
for Keyhole Markup Language, an XML file that contains geographic
information.
